## C9 Deployment
Cloud 9 deployment documentation

### Switch to node 8
```
nvm alias default node
nvm use default
```

### Install Yarn
You can use npm if you know what you are doing.  This documentation will use yarn.
```
npm install -g yarn
```

### Configure yarn
```
export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"
```

### Install Yeoman
First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-paypal-integrations using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
yarn global add yo
yarn global add generator-paypal-integrations
```

### Generate 
Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo paypal-integrations
```

### Configure
Configure the environment variables or the .env file if you had it generated.

### Execute
```
yarn build
yarn start  
```

## Debugging
You can debug the application by creating a new run confguration and selecting the paypal-integrations runner.

### Create Run Configuration
Click the run button at the top and select new run configuration
![Run Configuration1][rc1]
* Name the configuration Paypal-Integrations
* Command is "./"
* Select paypal-integrations as the runner
* Click the CWD and select the root folder
* Click Run.

![Run Configuration2][rc2]![Run Configuration3][rc3]

The final run configration should look like the image below if you go to Run->Run Configurations->Manage
![Run Configuration4][rc4]

You can now debug and set breakpoints in the code.
